# the-c-programming-excercises
Solutions for the problems in K and R textbook chapter wise.

//The left out exercises and solutions can be looked in the below repository.

There are other repositories which have all the K and R execrises well documented and different approaches for each problem.

The one that I liked is : https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions

In each language the foundation of each structure is so important. Like the data types and ranges in C are really very important to understand. 
Sometimes I guessed we need to even understand how in-built function modules work or handle the input. Say for printf (included in stdio.h). It does take n arguments and different type of formats. Internally it does some type casting which goes uncovered. Which can sometimes lead to unpredictable behaviour. 

Are the two statements different? If so how?
  i) Learning a programming language 
  ii)Learning about that language compiler

Ranges and type casting has so much of importance in C programming which all lies between them. 

This is one live example : http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ariane.html. 

Hope we get better, learning these things too.
