# the-c-programming-excercises
Summary :
*Solutions for the problems in K and R textbook chapter wise.
*The left out exercises and solutions can be looked in the below repository.
*Repo : https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions
*The above repo has K and R execrises well documented and different approaches for each problem.

Notes :
Self :
*Are the two statements different? If so how?
  i) Learning a programming language 
  ii)Learning about that language compiler
*Hope we get better, learning these things too.
*Working on given exercises in the K & R book are really important. They help you to understand better.

Chapter 1:
*In each programming language the baiscs/foundation of each structure/concept is so important. Like the data types and ranges in C are really very important to understand. 
*Sometimes we need to even understand how in-built function modules work or handle the input. Say for printf (included in stdio.h). It does take n arguments and different type of formats. Internally it does some type casting which goes uncovered. Which can sometimes lead to unpredictable behaviour/results. 

Chapter 2:
*Ranges and type casting has so much of importance in C programming which all lies between them. 
*This is one live example : http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ariane.html. If we do not know what will be the range or values in that variable in languages like C.
*When left shift, the MSB bit value is filled in the empty spaces. (which can be sign magnitude) 

Chapter 3:
*getch() and ungetch() were good written useful functions for programs like reverse polish calculator.
